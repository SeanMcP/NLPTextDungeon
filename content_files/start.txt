Our world intersects with the realm of Shadow. Monsters occasionally are able to slip through into our world through
portals. They kill, and loot, and kidnap, and disappear back through their portals. Those they kidnap are never seen
again.

Dangerous men and women known as "Shades" are rumored to be able to open portals to the realm of Shadow.

They are formidable in combat, and even expert warriors hesitate to confront them one on one, but they are considered
bad luck in most countries.

=========

You are a Shade.

You were travelling through one such country when you were arrested. Someone found out you were a Shade and reported you
to the authorities. They ambushed you and locked you up. You've been in prison for many years. You do not have mad
skills anymore. Nonetheless, any Shade is dangerous. One day, the King has you brought up from the dungeons to a small
audience chamber. Two of the King's blood mages draw a large vial of blood while the guards hold you down.

When they've finished drawing the blood, you are thrust onto your knees in front of the King.

"I have a problem," he says. "My son and only heir Prince Ero is missing. The only lead we have as to his location
points to a location in Shadow. My blood mages tell me that you may be able to follow this lead. You will do so, find
my son, and bring him back, or you will die. My blood mages can use that blood to keep track of where you are and end
your life if I command. Do you understand?"
