## NLPTextDungeon Project

Hello and welcome! I started this project because I have an interest in 
[Natural Language Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) and wanted to learn more. I
came up with the idea of a "natural language" text dungeon (the user is "talking" to the dungeon master). Not a [new
concept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_fiction#Natural_language_processing) of course.

I started out by trying to query the Google Cloud Natural Language API, which was a definite learning experience. After
experimenting, I decided to try writing my own parser. It's still very much a work in progress.

The app is hosted at https://nlp-textdungeon.herokuapp.com/ . It is a free Heroku instance so it may take a minute to
load.

### Collaborators

I would be **very** interested in collaborating with another developer on this, particularly a front-end/graphic
designer (I am not a front-end guy as you can see). For more information, please see the heroku app.
